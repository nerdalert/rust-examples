    When there's lightning, 
    you know it always brings me down
    'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
    Who's lost and never found
    I cry out for magic, I feel it dancing in the light
    It was cold, I lost my hold
    To the shadows of the night
    No sign of the morning coming
    You've been left on your own
    Like a rainbow in the dark
    A rainbow in the dark
